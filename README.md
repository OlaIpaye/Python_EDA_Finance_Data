# Python_EDA_Finance_Data

This is the first assignment from the **Data Science in Finance with Python Course** I am currently taking, taught by Andrea Baroni of Barclays Bank.

In the assignment I used the Exploratory Data Analysis process to analyse loan term duration on default loan status. I worked with a **large financial dataset of 100,000 rows and 159 columns**.

The project code is in the attached file - LTD_DLS_Assignment_One - [Check out the project file](https://github.com/OlaIpaye/Python_EDA_Finance_Data/blob/main/LTD_DLS_Assignment_One.ipynb)
